Conway's Game Of Life
=====================


This is the source for [life.bitballoon.com](http://life.bitballoon.com) - an HTML5 implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

The Game of Life widget is implemented in [javascript/life.js](javascript/life.js) and has lots of dependencies on Bootstrap3 and the Bootstrap Slider.

As an example, it can be called like this:

```html

<div id="pattern" 
     class="life"
     data-stats-show="false"
     data-speed-show="false"
     data-clear-show="false"
     data-randomize-show="false"
     data-url="patterns/pattern.lif"
     data-editable="false">
     
       This is a pattern description. 
       
</div>
```
...
